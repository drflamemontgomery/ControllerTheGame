Controller The Game
===

Controller The Game is a virtual controller game designed to be played with a bunch of friends.
It's inspired by the game [Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime](https://store.steampowered.com/app/252110/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Spacetime/).
You control a Virtual Controller Ship which has components which you can customize.
This controller ship is a representation of a controller device which can be used to control another game. Fortnite, for example.
You can map buttons and Axes to the controller components which creates a system similar to how Steam handles its controller remapping.
You can only control one component at a time, and friends can sabotage your ship.
